    <p>My first introduction to coding was in school at the age of 13. It was completely unappealing to me at the time. However, since introducing it to myself again at the start of the year, I have found a passion for it. The school I attented at 13 was in one of the more rough areas of Swansea. The teaching was poor, the lessons were constantly disrupted by loud students and the year that I sat my GCSE's we had the worst results in the entire city. Thinking back I can see that my initial dispassion towards coding was in how it was taught and introduced to me, not the actual coding itself.</p>
    <p>The past 6 months, I have fallen in love with coding. It's a very creative process which leaves you with a sense of satisfaction after you have completed a project. I enjoy understanding how things work at a root level. I like to take things apart to see what it's made of and why it functions the way it does. Many people do things subconciously without understanding what it is they're doing. Coding forces you out of this. You can't create a function in coding without first understanding how it works. Writing a function is a creative process where you must first develop an understanding of what you are trying to achieve, break it down into step by step manageable parts and then communicate it to the computer in a concise manner with no ambiguity.</p>
    <p>Coding is essentialy the process of creating logic. Being able to write high quality functions requires inherent understanding of the function, problem solving skills, creativity and communication skills. These are all processes which I take great joy in and traits which I have in abundance. I'm a person who's naturally creative (the lion on the homepage I drew myself), I think outside of the box for new and useful ideas and I persevere through callenges I encounter. This combined with my passion for coding makes me believe that I am the ideal candidate for this role.</p>
    <p>Throughout the courses I've done, I've learnt skills which are transferable between programming languages and roles. I feel that coding has made me a more intelligent and resilient individual as I have learnt processes for dealing with problems. Many times I have come across an issue which was not solveable through previous methods which has led me to discover new ways of doing things and which I take with me into future problems. Online learning possesses challenges not present in traditional education as there's not always a tutor on hand to help you. However, this has not detered me as I seek out resources to help me. From online courses, StackOverflow and YouTube, I have found guidance to my problems from a vast range of sources. In a field where advancements come fast and technology always moves forward, the most important trait is the ability to keep learning to stay on top of the industry. I cannot promise that I know everything. But I can promise that if something is important, I can learn it.</p>
    <p>I frequently attend coding meets. Being a good software developer requires colloboration with your colleagues to be able to meet project demands. I pride myself on my communication skills and frequently attend coding meets. Attending coding meets has been a fantastic experience for me. I have been able to gain advice from more experienced professionals, improve my skills and make friends along the way. Meeting people of different backgrounds and personalities has been enlightening and hearing their stories has shown me that coding can be for anyone. On top of this, I am very active on the CodeCademy and FreeCodeCamp Forums. Whilst I'm not an expert, I take the opportunity to help others where I can with the skills I've learnt. </p>
