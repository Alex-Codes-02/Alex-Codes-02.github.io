    <h4 class="l s one">Sport</h4>
    <p>Growing up my favourite sport was always football. I played in football teams from a young age and immediately developed a sense of togetherness. My team-working and communication skills came naturally to me through the years as I switched from team to team making new bonds along the way. As a teenager I trained in Boxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I really loved the competitive element of these sports. They challenged me to work on my perseverance and gave me a habit of persistance which I carry with me into everything that I do. I no longer train martial arts. When you realise you're not good enough to make a career out of it, the consistent knocks to the head seem less and less worth the hassle. Although my love for these sports remains. The only sport I watch on TV is MMA. Whilst I don't consider myself a mega-fan, I like to keep up with the big events when they are on. I tried dancing for a certain period. I'm not good enough to have everyone's eyes on me at a party but I do have a killer moonwalk.</p>
    <h4 class="r b one">Fitness</h4>
    <p>There's rarely a day that I'm not in the gym. I love to lift weights and see my progress slowly build over time. I even manage to drag myself to the gym for the occasional dreaded cardio session. Whilst I do love the gym, it can sometimes be repetitive in that there's no tactical element like a sport. I've recently been considering dropping my cardio days for some kind of a sport but I am yet to do this. Slowly over time I've also improved my diet since my teenage years. My sugar consumption has gone way down, and as someone who has always struggled with eczema, I can say my skin has certainly felt the benefit. I have a dog named Alfie and though I no longer live with him and my parents, I'm never happier than on the days I get to take him somewhere.</p>
    <h4 class="l b two">Philosophy</h4>
    <p>Philosophy is by far my biggest passion. Whilst it's rare to find someone who shares this interest, me and my best friend often send each other voice messages late into the night whilst we have our mini-existential crises. I think there's nothing more interesting to do than to ponder the nature of things, explore new ideas and discuss these in a civilised manner. My favourite philosopher was a French-Algerian author named Albert Camus. We developed a strain of philosophy called absurdism which I believe in greatly. I think that everybody engages in philosophy whether they know it or not. Anytime they stop to think about something, whether they intend to or not they are engaging in philosophy. I also enjoy learning about psychology, a field which I think is closely related. And by developing interests in these fields I have to say that my personal happiness and passion for life is much higher.</p>
    <h4 class="r s two">Dogs</h4>
    <p>As I mentioned two paragraphs above, I love my dog. His name's Alfie (I'll include a photo of him at the bottom of this page). We've had him since a pup and he's now 8 years old. You'd always find him at the center of mischief when he was young. I'd like to say we've grown up together. I didn't know much about the world at 14 and I've chnaged a lot since then. My personality, habits and world views have evolved a lot since then. Alfie's been with me every step through that. We've grown together and shared a lot of memories. We've spent many nights watching TV in our warm familiar house and almost as many covered in mud, wet and tired watching lakes in places we've never been before. He's the best boy and a blessing to have in my life.</p>
    <h4 class="three">General</h4>
    <p>In general I would say that above anything else I love to learn. I think learning keeps life novel. I enjoy breaking stuff down to see what makes they're made of and how they work. Sometimes you find that something you've learnt in one field can help you in an unrelated field and it's just marvellous to see how these things connect. I can say that taking physics at A-Level helped me when it came to boxing and dancing. I think it's great to be constantly taking on new challenges to see what more you can become and what you can discover. I like to try new foods, go places I've never been and talk to people of all different personalities and backgrounds. Life is so full of exciting things that we'll never get to try all of them but I enjoy exploring as many of them as I can.</p>
