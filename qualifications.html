    <div class="text one"><p>In this course I gained a broad understanding of the python language and its' functions. There were lessons set around the theme of working with data types, creating functions and understanding classes. The course ended with projects to test my understanding of these concepts which I completed to obtain the certification. Since completing the course I have updated the code for these projects which was initially innefficient (although it worked). To see my updated code please visit this <a>link</a>.</p></div>
    <div class="text two"><p>This is the third qualification in a 3 part course from Stanford online (the certificates from the first 2 part are available on my <a>LinkedIn</a>).The course went over fundamental concepts about how AI systems are able to use data to uncover trends and patterns in the data. Throughout the course there were many projects to complete where I had to implement the AI systems in python. Data would then be passed to the systems I had created to check if the code functioned as intended. Whilst this course may not be software development specific, it was interesting to see how python may be implemented to create systems with a market purpose. Some of the systems were quite complex to create functions for and I feel my python abilities improved dramatically through this course. Particularly, it was my first introduction to working with TensorFlow and Pandas.</p></div>
