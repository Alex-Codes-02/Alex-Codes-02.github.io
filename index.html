    Hi,<br/>
    Thank you for taking a look at my CV<br/>
    I created this myself using HTML and CSS coding I learned from online courses<br/>
    At the beginning of this year I was in University studying finance and was well on track to achieve a First Class Honours<br/>
    When I saw a large amount of my fellow students using ChatGPT to do our coursework and get perfect answers, I got concerned about the future employability of the skills I was learning<br/>
    I ultimately decided to drop the course<br/>
    I wasn't sure what path I was going to go on next but was sure that I would be able to work something out<br/>
    I decided to start learning coding online<br/>
    I began with python, then took a machine learning course from Stanford Online<br/>
    I enjoyed these courses but still felt unsure as to what exact path I should be taking<br/>
    I began going to Coding meets so that I could meet people with more knowledge and experience than me<br/>
    I met many different people, all with a different story about how they started working in tech<br/>
    Getting to hear their stories was incredibly insightful and I'm glad to say I've made some friends along the way<br/>
    It was from one of these friends I heard of this opportunity from Technative and I have been learning from the <a class="mainl" href="https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer">Codecademy Full Stack Developer Curriculum</a> in preperation<br/>
    I hope this opening message hasn't been too long<br/>
    Please navigate to my <a class="mainl" href="./ps.html">Personal Statement</a> where I talk about how I've come to unexpectedly enjoy coding and why I believe I would be a good fit for this role
